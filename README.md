# Incentify

> Motivation app through financial consequences

By tracking metric based achievement sites (Fitbit/Duolingo), we can interface with their API and let users set a goal (5 miles per week) and a financial incentive ($10). If they fail to meet that weekly goal, they get charged through the Stripe API.
